//! GetHealthStatus
//! ---------------
//! This API serves multiple purposes
//!
//! It is used to ensure that the XKS Proxy base URL (https://!<server>/<path-prefix>/kms/xks/v1)
//! and SigV4 credentials required to communicate with the proxy are configured correctly in KMS.
//!
//! It is used to ensure that the XKS Proxy is ready to handle
//! other API requests (encrypt/decrypt/getKeyMetadata)
//!
//! It is used to gather information for proactively monitoring availability risks
//! and processing KMS customer requests to raise the Transactions Per Second (TPS) limit
//! on their external key manager.
//!
//! Before returning a successful response (HTTP 200 OK),
//! the XKS Proxy SHOULD verify not only that the external key manager is reachable
//! but is also able to perform cryptographic operations, i.e. the health-check SHOULD be deep
//! rather than shallow.
//!
//! The health check should be implemented such that a successful check provides strong assurance
//! that an encrypt, decrypt or getKeyMetadata request issued immediately
//! after will succeed (except due to authorization checks).
//!
//! The XKS Proxy SHOULD create test keys in the external key manager
//! and invoke cryptographic operations on them as part of the deep Healthcheck.
//!
//! This API MUST be excluded from secondary authorization if the XKS Proxy implements such authorization.
//!
//! HTTP Method: POST
//!
//! API specs: https://github.com/aws/aws-kms-xksproxy-api-spec/blob/main/xks_proxy_api_spec.md#gethealthstatus
