# Snowflake Native App for Large-Scale Data Encryption

Cosmian offers a Snowflake Native App that seamlessly integrates with the Cosmian KMS to provide robust encryption and
decryption capabilities directly within your Snowflake environment. This solution builds upon
the [Python UDF library](../python_udf/index.md) to deliver enterprise-grade cryptographic operations at scale.

The Native App exposes dedicated `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions that can be called directly from Snowflake SQL
queries, allowing you to implement column-level encryption without modifying your existing data workflows.

You can find the Snowflake Native App on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cosmian/kms_snowflake_native_app/), where
comprehensive documentation covers deployment procedures, configuration options, and usage examples to help you get
started quickly.
