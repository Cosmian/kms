To enjoy the KMS using the SaaS offering on the Cosmian public platform, simply access to: [kms.cosmian.com](https://kms.cosmian.com).

Compared to the on-premise self-installation, this service is configured using: 

- A database running inside an SGX enclave. Cosmian can't therefore access its content.
- The SSL certificates of the HTTP server are generated by the enclave. Cosmian can't therefore access them, so that the communications between you and the server are completly secure.

> The KMS supports a payload (file to encrypt/decrypt) size up to 10GB. Sending a larger payload will result in a 413 HTTP error.

## Trustworthiness

The KMS enable you to check its trustworthiness. To do so, three routes are useful, using `GET` method:

- `/quote?nonce=<nonce>` returning the quote of the KMS running inside the enclave. It takes a nonce as parameter which is an arbitrary and non predictable string. The returning quote is base64 encoded.
- `/certificate` returning the SSL certificate of the HTTPS server
- `/manifest` returning the manifest of the enclave. You can therefore analyse the hashes of the trusted files and the execution context such as env variables or enclave parameters

With these three routes, you can proceed a remote attestation on Microsoft Azure Service. Note that the report data of the quote is generated has follow:

```
report_data = Sha256( Sha256(manifest) + nonce + certificate ))
```

Let's explain why:

- The **ssl certificate** is encrypted using the `mr_enclave` key. Therefore if the server is updated, the certificates will be also updated and the quote will vary. Moreover this parameter is public, so you are plenty aware when the certificate changes.
- The **nonce** is added to make the quote unique each time the user want a proof a trust. It uses an arbitrary and non predictable string. The kms server can't therefore send a previous verify version of the quote.
- The **manifest** assures you that the manifest you will read is the one the enclave is using and therefore *Cosmian* can't alter the hash of the trusted files.

These three attributes enable you to fully verify the trustworthiness of the enclave we are running.
