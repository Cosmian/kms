To enjoy the KMS using the SaaS offering on the Cosmian public platform, simply access to: [kms.cosmian.com](https://kms.cosmian.com).

Compared to the on-premise self-installation, this service is configured using: 

- A database running inside an SGX enclave. Cosmian can't therefore access its content.
- The SSL certificates of the HTTP server are generated by the enclave. Cosmian can't therefore access them, so that the communications between you and the server are completly secure.

> The KMS supports a payload (file to encrypt/decrypt) size up to 10GB. Sending a larger payload will result in a 413 HTTP error.
