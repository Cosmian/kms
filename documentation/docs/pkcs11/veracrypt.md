The Cosmian KMS is integrated with [Veracrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html)
disk encryption using the Cosmian KMS PKCS#11 provider library.

Veracrypt is a free open-source disk encryption software for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux
which is successor of TrueCrypt, certified by ANSSI. Veracrypt has received a
formal security evaluation from BSI.

Using the Cosmian KMS PKCS#11 provider library, Veracrypt can use keys stored in the KMS to
encrypt and decrypt volumes.

## Installing the PKCS#11 provider library on Veracrypt

Go to Veracrypt `Settings > Security Tokens` and use the `Select Library...`
button to select the Cosmian KMS PKCS#11 library for your operating system.
Then click `OK`.

## Configuring access to the KMS

The PKCS#11 provider library uses the same configuration file as the [CLI](../cli/cli.md).

See [Authenticating users to the KMS](../authentication.md#authenticating-using-tls-client-certificates)
to learn
how to configure the
KMS to use Open ID connect or certificate authentication (please note that the KMS can
also manage the machines certificates).

Here is an example configuration file for the PKCS#11 provider library accessing the KMS using a
PKCS#12 file for authentication.

```json
{
  "kms_server_url": "https://kms.acme.com:9999",
  "ssl_client_pkcs12_path": "./certificates/machine123.acme.p12",
  "ssl_client_pkcs12_password": "machine123_pkcs12_password"
}
```

To use Open ID connect, install the `ckms` CLI from https://package.cosmian.com/kms/ and
use the `ckms login` command to authenticate to the KMS first.

## Creating keys to use with Veracrypt

The keys used to encrypt Veracrypt volumes are created in the KMS as Symmetric Keys and must
carry at least two tags, one being `disk-encryption`. The other tag(s) will be displayed to the
user in the Veracrypt GUI when selecting the key to use to mount the volume. The other tag(s) can
also be used to identify the key when using Veracrypt CLI.

To create a key using the CLI, that will be shown as `vol1`to the user, use the following command:

```sh
ckms sym keys create -t disk-encryption -t vol1
```

Do not forget to grant Get access to the key to the machine that will mount the Veracrypt volume.

```sh
ckms access-rights grant <MACHINE_CN> <KEY_ID> get
```

where `<MACHINE_CN>` is the Common Name of the certificate used to authenticate the machine to the
KMS and `<KEY_ID>` is the ID of the key created in the previous step.

## Mounting a Veracrypt volume using the GUI

When mounting a Veracrypt volume, select the `Use keyfiles` option and select the key to use to
mount the volume using the `Keyfiles...` button.

Click `Add Token Files...`

![Veracrypt key selection 2](images/Veracrypt-select-token-2.png)

Select the key to use to mount the volume and click `OK`

![Veracrypt key selection 3](images/Veracrypt-select-token-3.png)

## Mounting a Veracrypt volume using the CLI

When mounting a Veracrypt volume using the CLI, use the `-k` option followed by
`token://slot/1/file/vol1` where `vol1` is the other tag chosen to identify the key in the KMS.

## Revoking the access to a key

To revoke the access to the key, either

- remove the access to the key <KEY_ID> for the machine <MACHINE_CN> using the following command:

```bash
ckms access-rights revoke <MACHINE_CN> <KEY_ID> get
```

- revoke the key itself using the following command:

```bash
ckms sym keys revoke <KEY_ID>
```

_Note_: a revoked key can never be re-used.

## Rotating a key

To rotate a key,

1. Create a new key.
2. Grant access to the machine to the new key.
3. Perform the key rotation/change in the Veracrypt GUI or CLI.
4. Revoke the access to the old key for the machine.
5. Optionally revoke the old key itself.
