# Cosmian KMS

The **Cosmian KMS** is a high-performance, [**source available**](https://github.com/Cosmian/kms), [**FIPS 140-3 compliant**](./fips.md) 
server application written in [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with unique capabilities.

## High-scale, secure encryption, anywhere

- **High-performance**: Delivers encryption and decryption services at up to **millions of operations per second**,
  with master keys held in a secure HSM-backed environment.
- **Flexible pricing**: Per-CPU pricing with no hidden costs, all connectors are included; deploying any number of
  servers.
- **Runs securely in public clouds**:  or zero-trust environments using Cosmian VMs available
  on [Azure, GCP, and AWS marketplaces](https://cosmian.com/marketplaces/) - see
  our [deployment guide](installation/marketplace_guide.md).

## Standards' compliance

- [FIPS 140-3](./fips.md) mode
- KMIP support (versions 1.0-1.4, 2.0-2.1) in both binary and JSON formats -
  see [KMIP documentation](./kmip/index.md)
- [HSM support](./hsms/index.md) for Trustway Proteccio & Crypt2Pay, Utimaco general purpose, Nitrokey HSM 2, Smartcard
  HSMs,...
  with KMS keys wrapped by the HSM
- Developed in Rust, a memory safe language, with the source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cosmian/kms)
- 100% developed in the European Union

## Modern technology

- [Source Available](https://github.com/Cosmian/kms) server application written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

- Advanced [authentication mechanisms](./authentication.md)
- [High-availability mode](installation/high_availability_mode.md) with simple horizontal scaling
- Multi-language client support: Python, JavaScript, Dart, Rust, C/C++, and Java (see the `cloudproof` libraries
  on [Cosmian GitHub](https://github.com/Cosmian))

## Three-in-one: Key lifecycle management + Encryption oracle + Public key infrastructure

The **Cosmian KMS** combines the functions of a Key Management System, an Encryption Oracle, and a Public Key
Infrastructure:

- **Key Management System**: Manages the full key lifecycle, including on-the-fly generation and revocation, including
  for [connected HSMs](./hsms/index.md).
- **Encryption Oracle**: Provides high-availability, high-scalability encryption and decryption operations at **millions
  of operations per second** with [HSM-backed security](./hsms/index.md).
- **PKI**: Manages root and intermediate certificates, signs and verifies certificates, and uses public keys for
  encryption/decryption. Certificates can be exported in various formats (including _PKCS#12_) for applications like
  _S/MIME_ encrypted emails.

The **Cosmian KMS** supports all standard NIST cryptographic algorithms as well as advanced post-quantum cryptography
algorithms like [Covercrypt](https://github.com/Cosmian/cover_crypt). See the
complete [supported algorithms list](./algorithms.md).

## Deployment options

The **Cosmian KMS** is available as:

- Package: [Debian](https://package.cosmian.com/kms/5.10.0/ubuntu-22.04/)
  or [RPM](https://package.cosmian.com/kms/5.10.0/rockylinux9/)
- Docker: [Standard image](https://github.com/Cosmian/kms/pkgs/container/kms)
  and [FIPS image](https://github.com/Cosmian/kms/pkgs/container/kms)
- [Pre-built binaries](https://package.cosmian.com/kms/5.10.0/) for Linux, Windows, and macOS

## User Interface

The **Cosmian KMS** includes an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) with support for client certificate and OIDC
token authentication.

## Client CLI

The [Cosmian CLI](../cosmian_cli/index.md) provides a powerful command-line interface for managing the server, handling
keys, and performing encryption/decryption operations. It features integrated help and is available for multiple
operating systems.

The **[Cosmian CLI](../cosmian_cli/index.md)** is packaged as:

- [Debian](https://package.cosmian.com/kms/5.10.0/ubuntu-22.04/)
  or [RPM](https://package.cosmian.com/kms/5.10.0/rockylinux9/) package
- [Pre-built binaries](https://package.cosmian.com/cli/) for Linux, Windows, and macOS

**Note:** `ckms` has been replaced by [Cosmian CLI](../cosmian_cli/index.md) to manage other Cosmian products.
