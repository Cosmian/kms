The Cosmian KMS server supports a restricted set of the KMIP 2.1 protocol.

The Key Management Interoperability Protocol Specification Version 2.1 and Key Management Interoperability Protocol Profiles Version 2.1 are [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/) Standards.

The goal of the OASIS KMIP is to define a single, comprehensive protocol for communication between encryption systems and a broad range of new and legacy enterprise applications, including email, databases, and storage devices. By removing redundant, incompatible key management processes, KMIP provides better data security while at the same time reducing expenditures on multiple products.

KMIP is a massive specification and support is limited to the requirements of Cosmian advanced cryptography. Although the KMS server functionalities evolve quickly to support the growing demand of customers, the Cosmian KMS server, ike most KMS server, is in no way claiming to be a complete solution for all cryptographic objects and operations.
