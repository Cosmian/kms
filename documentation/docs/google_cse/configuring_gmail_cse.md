Follow the [Google documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13069736?hl=en&ref_topic=10742486) to enable S/MIME for client-side encryption in your organization and create a service account to interact with the Gmail API.

## Configure ckms client

The Cosmian `ckms` command line interface (CLI) simplifies the setup of S/MIME keys and certificates for users.

After completing the setup, update your [CLI configuration](../cli/cli.md#smime-gmail-service-account-configuration) with the necessary information for the service account you created for the Gmail API.

## Import certificates chain to Cosmian KMS

According to [Google's requirements](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7300887#zippy=%2Croot-ca%2Cintermediate-ca-certificates-other-than-from-issuing-intermediate-ca%2Cintermediate-ca-certificate-that-issues-the-end-entity%2Cend-entity-certificate) and [configuration guidelines](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13297070?hl=en#guidelines), upload the certificate chain to Cosmian KMS. This certificate chain will be used to generate user certificates.

```sh
ckms certificates import -f pkcs12 issuer_ca_certificate.p12 -p PASSWORD issuer_ca_certificate
```

If multiple administrators will be generating key-pairs for users, ensure that each administrator has the appropriate access rights to the imported certificate chain elements:
- the issuer certificate ID (given when importing the Certificate Authority)
- the issuer private key ID
- the issuer public key ID

In order to get the issuer private ID and issuer public key ID, run the following command:
`ckms -- get-attributes -i issuer_ca_certificate`


You'll use the ID of the issuer's private key (imported from the certificate chain) to later sign users' public keys and create their certificates.

## Create user key-pair

Gmail uses `key-pairs` (an RSA private key wrapped with its associated certificate) and `identities` (the ID of an uploaded key-pair, associated with a user) to sign and encrypt emails using S/MIME. These objects are uploaded to Google via the Gmail API.

You can create a key-pair (RSA private key and user certificate chain) and upload it to the Gmail API using the following command:

```sh
ckms google key-pairs create --cse-key-id CSE_KEY_ID --subject-name "C=FR, ST=IdF, L=Paris, O=YOUR_ORGANIZATION, OU=DEPARTMENT, CN=user@your_organization.com, emailAddress=user@your_organization.com" -i ISSUER_PRIVATE_KEY_ID user@your_organization.com
```

If you already have an existing RSA key-pair for the user, you can specify it in the command.

Once created, the ID of the key-pair will be displayed.

Note: It may take up to 24 hours for Google to propagate the Client-Side Encryption (CSE) activation for a user within the Gmail API, allowing you to upload the S/MIME elements.

## Insert user identity

After creating the key-pair, you must associate it with the userâ€™s identity. To do so, run the following command:

```sh
ckms google identities insert --user-id user@your_organization.com CREATED_KEYPAIR_ID
```

You can manage key-pairs (get, list, enable, disable, obliterate) and identities (get, list, delete, patch) using the other available commands in the `ckms` [commands documentation](../cli/main_commands.md).

Note: It may take a few hours for Google to propagate the uploaded elements, after which users can begin using S/MIME for secure email exchanges.

## User experience

To send a client-side encrypted email within your organization, a user needs to turn on the additional encryption option in the message window (lock -> Turn on additional encryption).
Only users with CSE activated can encrypt and decrypt encrypted emails.

To send a client-side encrypted email outside your organization, a user needs to send a message to the recipient with their digital signature, without CSE turned on. The recipient then needs to reply to the message with their digital signature. Then the sender can choose to add CSE to email sent to the external recipient.

Encrypted emails will be automatically decrypted from Gmail interface.
