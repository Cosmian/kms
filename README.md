The **Cosmian KMS** is both a Key Management System and a Public Key Infrastructure. As a KMS, it is designed to manage the lifecycle of keys and provide scalable cryptographic services such as on-the-fly key generation, encryption, and decryption operations.

The **Cosmian KMS** supports all the standard NIST cryptographic algorithms as well as advanced post-quantum cryptography algorithms such as [Covercrypt](https://github.com/Cosmian/cover_crypt). Please refer to the list of [supported algorithms](./documentation/docs/algorithms.md).

As a **PKI** it can manage root and intermediate certificates, sign and verify certificates, use their public keys to encrypt and decrypt data.
Certificates can be exported under various formats, including _PKCS#12_ modern and legacy flavor,
to be used in various applications, such as in _S/MIME_ encrypted emails.

The KMS has extensive online [documentation](https://docs.cosmian.com/key_management_system/)

## 🚀 Quick start

Pre-built binaries [are available](https://package.cosmian.com/kms/5.15.0/) for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, as well as Docker images. To run the server binary, OpenSSL must be available in your path (see "building the KMS" below for details); other binaries do not have this requirement.

Using Docker to quick-start a Cosmian KMS server on `http://localhost:9998` that stores its data inside the container, run the following command:

```sh
docker run -p 9998:9998 --name kms ghcr.io/cosmian/kms:latest
```

Then, use the CLI to issue commands to the KMS. The CLI, called `cosmian`, can be either:

- installed with `cargo install cosmian_cli`
- downloaded from [Cosmian packages](https://package.cosmian.com/cli/)
- built and launched from the [GitHub project](https://github.com/Cosmian/cli) by running

    ```sh
    cargo build --bin cosmian
    ```

### ▶️ Example

1. Create a 256-bit symmetric key

    ```sh
    ➜ cosmian sym keys create --number-of-bits 256 --algorithm aes --tag my-key-file
    ...
    The symmetric key was successfully generated.
      Unique identifier: 87e9e2a8-4538-4701-aa8c-e3af94e44a9e

      Tags:
        - my-key-file
    ```

2. Encrypt the `image.png` file with AES GCM using the key

    ```sh
    ➜ cosmian sym encrypt --tag my-key-file --output-file image.enc image.png
    ...
    The encrypted file is available at "image.enc"
    ```

3. Decrypt the `image.enc` file using the key

    ```sh
    ➜ cosmian sym decrypt --tag my-key-file --output-file image2.png image.enc
    ...
    The decrypted file is available at "image2.png"
    ```

See the [documentation](https://docs.cosmian.com/key_management_system/) for more.

directory.

## 🏗️ Building and running the KMS

Two paths are supported:

- For production use, use Nix build: use the unified script `.github/scripts/nix.sh` for a pinned toolchain,
  reproducible FIPS builds (non-FIPS builds are tracked for consistency), and packaging.
- For development purpose, use traditional `cargo` command: `cargo build...`, `cargo test`

### ✨ Features

From version 5.4.0, the KMS runs in FIPS mode by default.
The non-FIPS mode can be enabled by passing the `--features non-fips` flag to `cargo build` or `cargo run`.

The `interop` feature enables KMIP interoperability test operations, which are disabled by default for security reasons.
These operations should only be enabled during testing: `cargo build --features interop` or `cargo test --features interop`.

OpenSSL v3.2.0 is required to build the KMS.

### 🖥️ Linux or macOS

Nix-based (reproducible FIPS builds):

```sh
# Run tests (defaults to 'all'; DB backends require services)
bash .github/scripts/nix.sh test

# Package artifacts (Linux → deb+rpm, macOS → dmg)
bash .github/scripts/nix.sh package
```

Simple (Cargo-only):

```sh
cargo build
cargo test --lib --workspace
cargo test --lib --workspace --features non-fips
```

### 🪟 Windows

Follow the prerequisites below, or use the provided PowerShell helpers.

Prerequisites (manual):

1. Install Visual Studio (C++ workload + clang), Strawberry Perl, and `vcpkg`.
2. Install OpenSSL 3.1.2 with vcpkg:

```powershell
vcpkg install --triplet x64-windows-static  # arm64-windows-static for ARM64
vcpkg integrate install
$env:OPENSSL_DIR = "$env:VCPKG_INSTALLATION_ROOT\packages\openssl_x64-windows-static"
```

For FIPS builds (to build fips.dll):

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path "vcpkg_fips.json" -Destination "vcpkg.json"
vcpkg install
vcpkg integrate install
```

PowerShell helpers (non-FIPS by default):

```powershell
. .github/scripts/cargo_build.ps1
BuildProject -BuildType release   # or debug

. .github/scripts/cargo_test.ps1
TestProject -BuildType release    # or debug
```

### 🐳 Build the Docker Ubuntu container

You can build a Docker image that contains the KMS server as follows:

```sh
docker buildx build . -t kms
```

Or, with FIPS support:

```sh
docker buildx build --build-arg FIPS="true" -t kms .
```

### 📦 Packaging (DEB/RPM/DMG) and hashes

Use the Nix entrypoint to build packages:

```sh
# Linux
bash .github/scripts/nix.sh package           # builds deb + rpm
bash .github/scripts/nix.sh package deb       # build deb only
bash .github/scripts/nix.sh package rpm       # build rpm only

# macOS
bash .github/scripts/nix.sh package dmg
```

On success, a SHA-256 checksum file (.sha256) is written next to each generated package
(.deb/.rpm/.dmg) to ease verification and artifact distribution.

## 🧪 Running the unit and integration tests

Pull the test data using:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

By default, tests are run using `cargo test` and an SQLCipher backend (called `sqlite`).
This can be influenced by setting the `KMS_TEST_DB` environment variable to

- `sqlite`, for plain SQLite
- `mysql` (requires a running MySQL or MariaDB server connected using a
  `"mysql://kms:kms@localhost:3306/kms"` URL)
- `postgresql` (requires a running PostgreSQL server connected using
  a `"postgresql://kms:kms@127.0.0.1:5432/kms"`URL)
- `redis-findex` (requires a running Redis server connected using a
  `"redis://localhost:6379"` URL)

Example: testing with a plain SQLite and some logging

```sh
RUST_LOG="error,cosmian_kms_server=info,cosmian_kms_cli=info" KMS_TEST_DB=sqlite cargo test
```

Alternatively, when writing a test or running a test from your IDE, the following can be inserted
at the top of the test:

```rust
unsafe {
set_var("RUST_LOG", "error,cosmian_kms_server=debug,cosmian_kms_cli=info");
set_var("RUST_BACKTRACE", "1");
set_var("KMS_TEST_DB", "redis-findex");
}
log_init(option_env!("RUST_LOG"));
```

## ⚙️ Development: running the server with cargo

To run the server with cargo, you need to set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to the desired
log level and select the correct backend (which defaults to `sqlite`).

```sh
RUST_LOG="info,cosmian_kms_server=debug" \
cargo run --bin cosmian_kms --features non-fips -- \
--database-type redis-findex --database-url redis://localhost:6379 \
--redis-master-password secret --redis-findex-label label
```

## 🔧 Server parameters

If a configuration file is provided, parameters are set following this order:

- conf file (env variable `COSMIAN_KMS_CONF` set by default to `/etc/cosmian/kms.toml`)
- default (set on struct)

Otherwise, the parameters are set following this order:

- args in the command line
- env var
- default (set on struct)

## ☁️ Use the KMS inside a Cosmian VM on SEV/TDX

See the [Marketplace guide](documentation/docs/installation/marketplace_guide.md) for more details about Cosmian VM.

## 🏷️ Releases

All releases can be found in the public URL [package.cosmian.com](https://package.cosmian.com/kms/).

## 📈 Benchmarks

To run benchmarks, go to the `crate/test_kms_server` directory and run:

```sh

#### Methodology

- Operations marked ✅ are backed by a Rust implementation file under `crate/server/src/core/operations`.
- Operations marked ❌ are defined in the KMIP specification but not implemented in Cosmian KMS.
- Operations marked N/A do not exist in that particular KMIP version.
- This documentation is auto-generated by analyzing source code and KMIP specifications.

Notes:

- Opaque Object import support is present (see `import.rs`).
- PGP Key types appear in digest and attribute handling but full object import/register is not implemented, hence ❌.
- Template objects are deprecated in newer KMIP versions.

Notes:

- GetAttributes returns a union of metadata attributes and those embedded in KeyBlock structures.
- "Vendor Attributes" are available via the Cosmian vendor namespace and are accessible via GetAttributes.
- A ✅ indicates the attribute is used or updated by at least one KMIP operation implementation in `crate/server/src/core/operations`, including attribute handlers (Add/Delete/Set/Get Attribute).
- Most attributes are present across all KMIP versions with some additions in newer versions.
