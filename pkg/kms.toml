# - JWKS_URI: The JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) URI (optional; defaults to <JWT_ISSUER_URI>/.well-known/jwks.json if empty or omitted)
# - JWT_AUDIENCE_n: Zero or more allowed audiences (optional). If multiple are provided,
#                   validation succeeds if the token "aud" contains any of them (any-of).
#                   If no audiences are provided, audience validation is skipped.
# Examples:
# - "https://accounts.google.com,https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs,my-audience"
# - "https://auth0.example.com,,my-app"  (JWKS URI will default)
# - "https://keycloak.example.com/auth/realms/myrealm,," (no audience, JWKS URI will default)
# - "https://issuer.example.com,https://issuer.example.com/jwks.json,frontend,cli" (multi-audience)
# Multiple providers can be listed. Duplicate entries (same issuer/JWKS) are deduplicated; last wins.
