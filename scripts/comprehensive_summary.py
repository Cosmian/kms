üéâ PYKMIP TEST SUITE COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY
==========================================

‚úÖ OPERATIONS SUCCESSFULLY ADDED:

1. ‚úÖ REVOKE OPERATION
   - Creates symmetric key and attempts revoke
   - Reports KMIP parameter mismatch (revocation_reason vs revocation_reason_code)
   - Positioned between 'get' and 'destroy' operations
   - Command: ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh revoke

2. ‚úÖ DISCOVER_VERSIONS OPERATION  
   - Discovers negotiated KMIP protocol version
   - Lists supported operations and infers KMIP capabilities
   - Positioned as FIRST operation (logical testing flow)
   - Command: ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh discover_versions

3. ‚úÖ ENCRYPT OPERATION
   - Creates symmetric key and tests encrypt functionality only
   - Independent from decrypt, focused testing
   - Positioned after 'get', before 'revoke' operations
   - Command: ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh encrypt

üîß OPERATIONS ENHANCED:

1. ‚úÖ DESTROY OPERATION IMPROVED
   - Now attempts revoke before destroy (best practice)
   - Reports both revoke and destroy status separately
   - Enhanced error reporting with dependency information

2. ‚úÖ ALL RESULT STATUS CHECKING FIXED
   - All operations now properly check server result_status field
   - No more false positive success reports
   - Detailed error information for failures

üéØ CURRENT OPERATIONS SEQUENCE:

FULL TEST SEQUENCE (10 operations):
  1. discover_versions ‚Üê NEW (version discovery)
  2. query             (server capabilities)
  3. create            (key creation)
  4. get               (attribute retrieval)
  5. encrypt           ‚Üê NEW (encryption only)
  6. revoke            ‚Üê NEW (key revocation)
  7. destroy           ‚Üê ENHANCED (revoke + destroy)
  8. encrypt_decrypt   (full crypto cycle)
  9. create_keypair    (asymmetric keys)
  10. locate           (object enumeration)

üìä CURRENT COMPATIBILITY STATUS:

‚úÖ WORKING OPERATIONS (6/10 = 60%):
  ‚úÖ discover_versions - Version discovery and capability mapping
  ‚úÖ query            - Server information and supported operations
  ‚úÖ create           - AES symmetric key creation
  ‚úÖ get              - Attribute retrieval (with COMMENT filtering)
  ‚úÖ create_keypair   - RSA key pair generation
  ‚úÖ locate           - Object enumeration and search

‚ùå FAILING OPERATIONS (4/10 = 40%):
  ‚ùå encrypt          - KMIP parser incompatibility (TTLV parsing)
  ‚ùå revoke           - Parameter name mismatch (revocation_reason vs revocation_reason_code)
  ‚ùå destroy          - KMIP 1.x ‚Üí 2.1 conversion not supported + revoke dependency
  ‚ùå encrypt_decrypt  - TTLV response parsing incompatibility

üõ†Ô∏è TEST SCRIPT IMPROVEMENTS:

ENHANCED ERROR DETECTION:
  - 30-second timeouts to prevent hanging
  - Multiple failure condition checks
  - Comprehensive JSON status parsing
  - Detailed operation output display
  - Clear success/failure reporting

IMPROVED WORKFLOW:
  - Continue all tests even if some fail
  - Comprehensive summary at end
  - Color-coded status messages
  - Clear visual separation between operations

üîç TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:

COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS:
  - Identified specific KMIP version incompatibilities
  - Mapped PyKMIP parameter names to server expectations
  - Documented TTLV parsing issues with response formats
  - Provided workarounds and technical details

ERROR CATEGORIZATION:
  - KMIP version compatibility issues (encrypt, encrypt_decrypt)
  - Parameter name mismatches (revoke)
  - Protocol conversion limitations (destroy)
  - Successful operations with proper status reporting

üéØ USAGE COMMANDS:

INDIVIDUAL OPERATIONS:
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh discover_versions
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh query
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh create
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh get
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh encrypt         ‚Üê NEW
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh revoke          ‚Üê NEW
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh destroy         ‚Üê ENHANCED
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh encrypt_decrypt
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh create_keypair
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh locate

COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh all             # All operations
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh all -v          # Verbose mode

üí° KEY BENEFITS ACHIEVED:

1. üéØ COMPLETE OPERATION COVERAGE
   - All major KMIP operations now tested
   - Both working and failing operations properly identified
   - Logical test sequence from simple to complex

2. üîç ENHANCED DEBUGGING CAPABILITIES
   - Version discovery helps understand server capabilities
   - Isolated encrypt testing pinpoints specific issues
   - Detailed error categorization and workarounds

3. üìä ACCURATE STATUS REPORTING
   - Fixed false positive success reports
   - Comprehensive error details with technical information
   - Clear distinction between working and failing operations

4. üõ†Ô∏è ROBUST TEST INFRASTRUCTURE
   - Timeout handling prevents hanging tests
   - Continues testing even when operations fail
   - Clear visual output and comprehensive summaries

üéâ FINAL RESULTS:

TOTAL OPERATIONS: 10 (was 7, added 3 new)
SUCCESS RATE: 60% (6/10 operations working)
NEW OPERATIONS: discover_versions, encrypt, revoke
ENHANCED OPERATIONS: destroy (now with revoke)
IMPROVED: All operations now have proper status checking

The PyKMIP test suite now provides comprehensive coverage of KMIP operations
with accurate status reporting and detailed compatibility analysis!
