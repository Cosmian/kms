üîß ENCRYPT OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
===================================

‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:

1. ‚úÖ Added 'encrypt' to PyKMIP client operation choices
2. ‚úÖ Implemented perform_encrypt() function 
3. ‚úÖ Added encrypt operation handler in main()
4. ‚úÖ Updated test_pykmip.sh to include encrypt operation
5. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive help text and command parsing
6. ‚úÖ Positioned encrypt after basic operations (get) and before advanced ones (revoke)

üìù ENCRYPT OPERATION DETAILS:

FUNCTION: perform_encrypt(proxy, verbose=False)
PURPOSE: Test PyKMIP encrypt operation independently (without decrypt)
APPROACH: 
  - Create a symmetric AES-256 key
  - Attempt to encrypt test data using the key
  - Report encryption success/failure with detailed information
  - Clean up test key after operation

üîç ENCRYPT OPERATION FLOW:

STEPS:
  1. Create AES-256 symmetric key using proper template
  2. Validate key creation success
  3. Attempt to encrypt test data: "Hello, PyKMIP Encrypt Test!"
  4. Handle encryption result or compatibility issues
  5. Clean up test key (best effort)

ERROR HANDLING:
  - Create operation failure detection
  - KMIP compatibility issue identification
  - Detailed error reporting with workarounds
  - Graceful cleanup even on failures

üìä EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:

SUCCESS (if encryption works):
{
  "operation": "Encrypt",
  "status": "success",
  "uid": "key-uuid",
  "original_data": "48656c6c6f2c2050794b4d49502045...",
  "original_data_length": 27,
  "encrypted_data": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "encrypted_data_length": 48,
  "message": "Data encrypted successfully"
}

ERROR (current KMIP compatibility issue):
{
  "operation": "Encrypt",
  "status": "error",
  "uid": "key-uuid",
  "error": "KMIP version compatibility issue with encrypt operation",
  "technical_details": "PyKMIP 1.2 parser incompatible with Cosmian KMS response format: Invalid length used to read Base, bytes remaining: 24",
  "note": "Key creation succeeded, but encrypt operation has protocol parsing issues",
  "workaround": "Use direct REST API or update PyKMIP for KMIP 2.x compatibility"
}

üéØ INTEGRATION WITH TEST SUITE:

POSITION: 5th operation in test sequence
REASONING: After basic operations (query, create, get) but before complex ones (revoke, destroy)
COMMAND: ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh encrypt

NEW OPERATIONS ORDER:
  1. discover_versions
  2. query
  3. create
  4. get
  5. encrypt ‚Üê NEW
  6. revoke
  7. destroy
  8. encrypt_decrypt
  9. create_keypair
  10. locate

üìà TEST SCRIPT ENHANCEMENTS:

ADDED TO:
  - Operation choices in pykmip_client.py
  - Command parsing in test_pykmip.sh
  - Help text with proper description
  - Operations list for 'all' command

COMMAND USAGE:
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh encrypt
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh encrypt -v
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh all  # Includes encrypt as 5th operation

üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

KEY FEATURES:
  - Independent encrypt testing (no decrypt dependency)
  - AES-256 symmetric key creation
  - Test data encryption with hex output
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Automatic key cleanup

COMPATIBILITY DETECTION:
  - Identifies "Invalid length used to read Base" errors
  - Maps to known KMIP version parsing issues
  - Provides specific technical details
  - Suggests REST API workaround

COMPARISON WITH encrypt_decrypt:
  - encrypt: Tests encryption only, simpler, focused
  - encrypt_decrypt: Tests full cycle, more complex, includes verification

üí° BENEFITS:

1. üéØ Focused Testing: Isolates encrypt functionality from decrypt
2. üîç Clearer Diagnostics: Easier to identify encrypt-specific issues
3. üìä Granular Results: Separate success/failure reporting for encrypt vs decrypt
4. üõ†Ô∏è Better Debugging: Pinpoints exactly where KMIP compatibility breaks
5. üìà Progressive Testing: Logical flow from simple to complex operations

üö´ CURRENT STATUS:

EXPECTED RESULT: ‚ùå KMIP Compatibility Issue
REASON: PyKMIP 1.2 TTLV parser incompatible with Cosmian KMS KMIP 2.x response format
ERROR: "Invalid length used to read Base, bytes remaining: 24"
WORKAROUND: Use direct REST API for encrypt operations

üéâ CONCLUSION:

Encrypt operation successfully added to PyKMIP test suite:
- Provides focused encrypt-only testing capability
- Positioned logically in test sequence (5th position)
- Properly detects and reports KMIP compatibility issues
- Integrates seamlessly with existing test infrastructure
- Enhances debugging by isolating encrypt functionality

Total PyKMIP Operations: 10 (was 9, now includes standalone encrypt)
Encrypt-related Operations: 2 (encrypt + encrypt_decrypt)
Known Failing Operations: encrypt, encrypt_decrypt, revoke, destroy (4/10)
Working Operations: discover_versions, query, create, get, create_keypair, locate (6/10)
Success Rate: 60% (6/10 operations working)
