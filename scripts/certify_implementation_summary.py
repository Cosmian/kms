üéØ CERTIFY OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
===========================================

‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:

1. ‚úÖ Created separate file: scripts/pykmip_certify.py
2. ‚úÖ Implemented perform_certify() function in separate module
3. ‚úÖ Added 'certify' to PyKMIP client operation choices (alphabetically sorted)
4. ‚úÖ Added import and handler in main() function
5. ‚úÖ Updated test_pykmip.sh to include certify operation
6. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive help text and command parsing
7. ‚úÖ Positioned certify alphabetically in operations sequence

üìù CERTIFY OPERATION DETAILS:

FILE: scripts/pykmip_certify.py
FUNCTION: perform_certify(proxy, verbose=False)
PURPOSE: Test KMIP Certify operation (simulated via key pair creation and signing)
APPROACH: 
  - Since PyKMIP doesn't implement CERTIFY operation directly
  - Create RSA key pair (certification typically involves public keys)
  - Attempt to sign test data (signing is part of certification workflows)
  - Report results with detailed server capability information

üîç CERTIFICATION SIMULATION FLOW:

STEPS:
  1. Create RSA-2048 key pair using CommonTemplateAttribute
  2. Validate key pair creation success
  3. Attempt to sign test data using private key
  4. Handle signing result or server limitations
  5. Clean up test keys (best effort)

KEY TECHNICAL ASPECTS:
  - Uses CommonTemplateAttribute (required for key pairs)
  - RSA-2048 with SIGN/VERIFY usage masks
  - SHA-256 hashing with RSA encryption for signing
  - Handles both dict and object responses from PyKMIP
  - Detects KMIP 1.x operation support limitations

üìä EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:

ERROR (current Cosmian KMS limitation):
{
  "operation": "Certify",
  "status": "error",
  "private_key_uid": "key-uuid",
  "public_key_uid": "key-uuid_pk",
  "error": "KMIP Sign operation not supported by server",
  "technical_details": "Cosmian KMS KMIP 1.x mode: Invalid Request: Failed to parse RequestMessage: unsupported KMIP 1 operation: Sign",
  "note": "Key pair created successfully but Sign operation is not supported in KMIP 1.x",
  "workaround": "Use direct REST API or configure server for KMIP 2.x mode"
}

SUCCESS (if signing were supported):
{
  "operation": "Certify",
  "status": "success",
  "private_key_uid": "key-uuid",
  "public_key_uid": "key-uuid_pk",
  "test_data": "hex-encoded-test-data",
  "signature": "hex-encoded-signature",
  "signature_length": 256,
  "message": "Certification simulation completed successfully",
  "note": "KMIP CERTIFY operation simulated via key pair creation and signing"
}

üéØ INTEGRATION WITH TEST SUITE:

POSITION: 2nd operation in test sequence (alphabetical order)
COMMAND: ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh certify

UPDATED OPERATIONS ORDER:
  1. activate
  2. certify ‚Üê NEW
  3. create
  4. create_keypair
  5. decrypt
  6. destroy
  7. discover_versions
  8. encrypt
  9. get
  10. locate
  11. mac
  12. query
  13. revoke

üìà ARCHITECTURAL BENEFITS:

SEPARATED IMPLEMENTATION:
  ‚úÖ pykmip_certify.py contains perform_certify function
  ‚úÖ pykmip_client.py imports and uses the function
  ‚úÖ Cleaner code organization and modularity
  ‚úÖ Easier to maintain and extend individual operations
  ‚úÖ Demonstrates pattern for future operation additions

IMPORT PATTERN:
```python
elif args.operation == 'certify':
    from pykmip_certify import perform_certify
    result = perform_certify(proxy, args.verbose)
```

üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

KEY FEATURES:
  - Simulates KMIP CERTIFY operation (not directly supported by PyKMIP)
  - Creates RSA key pairs for certification simulation
  - Tests signing capability (core part of certification)
  - Comprehensive error handling with server capability detection
  - Automatic key cleanup

COMPATIBILITY DETECTION:
  - Identifies "unsupported KMIP 1 operation: Sign" errors
  - Maps to Cosmian KMS KMIP 1.x limitations
  - Provides specific technical details about operation support
  - Suggests workarounds and configuration options

üö´ CURRENT STATUS:

EXPECTED RESULT: ‚ùå KMIP Operation Not Supported  
REASON: Cosmian KMS doesn't support Sign operation in KMIP 1.x mode
ERROR: "unsupported KMIP 1 operation: Sign"
NOTE: Key pair creation succeeds, revealing server's partial KMIP support

üí° INSIGHTS PROVIDED:

1. üîç Server Capability Discovery: Shows which KMIP operations are supported
2. üéØ Partial Operation Success: Key creation works, signing doesn't
3. üìä KMIP Version Limitations: Reveals KMIP 1.x vs 2.x feature gaps
4. üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Pattern: Demonstrates modular operation implementation
5. üìà Testing Granularity: Tests complex workflows in logical steps

üéâ CONCLUSION:

Certify operation successfully added to PyKMIP test suite:
- Provides certification workflow testing capability
- Implemented in separate module for better organization
- Positioned alphabetically in test sequence (2nd position)
- Properly detects and reports KMIP operation support limitations
- Integrates seamlessly with existing test infrastructure
- Demonstrates modular architecture for future operations

Total PyKMIP Operations: 13 (was 12, now includes certify)
Known Unsupported Operations: certify (due to Sign dependency) 
Working Operations: activate, create, create_keypair, discover_versions, get, locate, query (7/13)
Server Limitations: certify, decrypt, destroy, encrypt, mac, revoke (6/13)
Success Rate: 53.8% (7/13 operations working)

The certify operation enhances our understanding of Cosmian KMS capabilities
and demonstrates clean modular architecture for operation implementations!
