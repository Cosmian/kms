🔧 DISCOVER VERSIONS OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
=============================================

✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:

1. ✅ Added 'discover_versions' to PyKMIP client operation choices
2. ✅ Implemented perform_discover_versions() function 
3. ✅ Added discover_versions operation handler in main()
4. ✅ Updated test_pykmip.sh to include discover_versions operation
5. ✅ Added comprehensive help text and command parsing
6. ✅ Positioned as first operation in test sequence

📝 DISCOVER VERSIONS OPERATION DETAILS:

FUNCTION: perform_discover_versions(proxy, verbose=False)
PURPOSE: Discover supported KMIP versions and protocol information
APPROACH: 
  - Query server for information and capabilities
  - Extract negotiated protocol version from PyKMIP proxy
  - Analyze supported operations to infer KMIP version capabilities
  - Provide comprehensive version information

🔍 VERSION DISCOVERY METHOD:

TECHNIQUE: Query-based inference
STEPS:
  1. Query server for information and capabilities
  2. Extract negotiated protocol version from proxy object
  3. Analyze supported operations list
  4. Map operations to KMIP version requirements:
     - Basic ops {1,2,3,4,8,10} → KMIP 1.0
     - Revoke (20) → KMIP 1.1+
     - Encrypt (32) → KMIP 1.2+
     - Advanced ops {29,19,23} → KMIP 2.0+

📊 EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
  "operation": "DiscoverVersions",
  "status": "success", 
  "negotiated_version": "1.2",
  "supported_operations": [1, 2, 8, 10, 20, 32, ...],
  "supported_operations_count": 15,
  "inferred_kmip_versions": ["1.0", "1.1+", "1.2+"],
  "server_information": {...},
  "version_discovery_method": "query_based_inference",
  "note": "Version discovery based on negotiated protocol and supported operations"
}

🎯 INTEGRATION WITH TEST SUITE:

POSITION: First operation in test sequence
REASONING: Version discovery should happen before other operations
COMMAND: ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh discover_versions

OPERATIONS ORDER:
  1. discover_versions ← NEW (first)
  2. query
  3. create
  4. get
  5. revoke
  6. destroy  
  7. encrypt_decrypt
  8. create_keypair
  9. locate

📈 TEST SCRIPT ENHANCEMENTS:

ADDED TO:
  - Operation choices in pykmip_client.py
  - Command parsing in test_pykmip.sh
  - Help text with proper description
  - Operations list for 'all' command

COMMAND USAGE:
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh discover_versions
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh discover_versions -v
  ./scripts/test_pykmip.sh all  # Includes discover_versions

🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

ERROR HANDLING:
  - Graceful handling of query failures
  - Fallback for unknown protocol versions
  - Comprehensive exception catching
  - Detailed error reporting

INFORMATION GATHERING:
  - Negotiated protocol version from proxy
  - Server information from query
  - Supported operations analysis
  - Version capability mapping

COMPATIBILITY:
  - Works with existing PyKMIP infrastructure
  - Uses standard query operation under the hood
  - Provides detailed version analysis
  - Compatible with current error reporting

💡 BENEFITS:

1. 🎯 Version Awareness: Know what KMIP capabilities are available
2. 🔍 Debugging Aid: Understand protocol negotiation results  
3. 📊 Compatibility Check: See which operations should work
4. 🛠️ Troubleshooting: Identify version-related issues
5. 📈 Documentation: Record supported KMIP features

🎉 CONCLUSION:

DiscoverVersions operation successfully added to PyKMIP test suite:
- Provides comprehensive KMIP version information
- Positioned as first operation for logical testing flow
- Uses reliable query-based inference method
- Integrates seamlessly with existing test infrastructure
- Enhances debugging and troubleshooting capabilities

Total PyKMIP Operations: 9 (was 8, now includes discover_versions)
New Test Sequence: discover_versions → query → create → get → revoke → destroy → encrypt_decrypt → create_keypair → locate
